# Data Science Immersive Capstone Project: Videogame Economy Analysis



## Introduction:

Oldschool Runescape is an mmorpg (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) videogame created by game developer Jagex. Players in this videogame often collect resources/items and trade with eachother in a market called the Grand Exchange (GE). The haphazard interactions of these players create a thriving economy within the videogame that can be used as a case study for other economies. This project is a dive into the virtual economy created within this game and an attempt to look at different forces that act within it to affect item prices. 


## Background:

What is the Grand Exchange? Is the market for players in OSRS. What makes it unique is that it is not controlled by the game developers, all prices are controled purely by supply and demand. Recently Jagex introduced a 1% tax for exchanges on the GE that would be charged to the seller. The gold confiscated by the tax would serve two purposes: a portion would be used to buy certain items off the exchange and delete them while the rest of the gold would be deleted. This action is called an "item-dump" and "gold-dump" within mmorpgs and can be an effective tool in counteracting the infinite supply that players could add.


## Problem Statement: 

This project is intended to look at the affect of adding a 1% tax to the virtual exchange has on the economy.

## Summary:

The purpose of this project is to look at how prices and trade volumes in a virtual economy differ over time along with a look at the introduction of a tax on a market.
